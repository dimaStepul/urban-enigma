I would like to do this without terminating the .EXE. I have been able to write to the on-disk image of a running .EXE before.

This eliminates the need for ZIPPING extra files and creates a nice portable executable application file that can be run anywhere with all previous data available in it.

This is SURELY not a far-fetched request or idea, and those who try to paint it as such are, in my opinion, doing the community a disservice.

A technique that allows for self-contained .exe files that can store their own content would be a MASSIVE BOON for the .NET software industry allowing for great portability, ease of use, and flexibility, especially if the technique were also possible with .NET Core."

Currently, I have received no answers addressing the problem itself, so I am hoping that this may bring attention to some deeper thinkers than myself who can determine a feasible way to do this. I am honestly convinced that it is impossible without the usage of some intense mathematical/algorithmic concept that I have yet to hear of in my time, so I am curious to see if there are any other methods out there as well. So long as any answer explains how this can be done *without* conditional error (or without pre-defining the weight of each and every individual line, as I want to be able to calculate that at runtime), or explains exactly why this is impossible to do (preferably with evidence) and perhaps talks about ways to mitigate the errors as much as possible, then I will award the bounty to the given answer."

That is, after I send test BTC using `docker exec -it minimal-crypto-exchange_node_1 bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress 2N23tWAFEtBtTgxNjBNmnwzsiPdLcNek181 0.5`, I want a piece of Java code be executed in which I can access, at least, the amount received by address `2N23tWAFEtBtTgxNjBNmnwzsiPdLcNek181` as well as the transaction ID.

Your solution must satisfy following criteria:

1. It must work with a local testnet set up using `docker-compose up -d` and [docker-compse.yml](https://github.com/mentiflectax/minimal-crypto-exchange/blob/i16/docker-compose.yml). You may change the `docker-compose.yml` file. The important thing is that I can operate it without relying on third parties (like faucets).
2. It must work under both Windows and MacOS.
3. It must be possible to use the code you have written in a Spring Boot application (a Camunda-based process engine)."

There are two tables - machines and parts. The machine can have n-parts installed and it should be able to get a list of these parts. 
One part can be installed on n machines and it should also be able to get a list of machines on which of them can be installed.
Where there should be a field that tells you how much of a particular part is used on a particular machine, it is clear that this field also needs to be read.

The proposed codes must be comparative with referred prepared ex-code on Colab GPU and TPU; Any additional explanations other than using *backend='cpu'*, if needed for using on CPUs, would be grateful.

The operational process of the code must be logical in terms of personal machine's hardware capabilities ( minimum: i5 4-cores, memory 16, and …; relatively). I just mentioned this minimum for any probable issues relating to proposed vectorization or parallelization methods to remove loops and …. Capability to handle at least 500.000 to 1.000.000 data volumes are satisfying by the aforementioned minimum system requirements.

More comprehensive code, which consider other conditions contain the initial ones, is of interest (not necessary). For example, in my code, it is considered that all spheres have at least one contact from the beginning, so I used some expressions for that e.g. *if len(nears_i_ind) <= 1*. This line, perhaps, could be removed and be considered in another way (it was just for an example)."

I expect this will require a call to Popper's setOptions(). Even with Popper.js itself (without Boostrap), there aren't good code examples of using setOptions() for offset or just about anything else! Since Bootstrap has decided to rely on Popper.js, it would be a great help to have a good code example of how to tweak Popper's offset behavior... and this could then likely be applied to other Popper behaviors for Bootstrap as well. I'm specifically interested in Bootstrap 5 but I think the same would apply to and work for Bootstrap 4. Thanks!"

I'm looking for code that demonstrates how to link these three bits of code together into one python code where i can interactively click on different nodes in the bubble plot and bring up different networks and in turn hyperlinks. 

I have just used networkX and matplotlib because that's the method I could figure out, but I'm open to any common python library as I'm not an expert in any of them.

Thanks."

- has a minimal feedback loop when adding a new label (e.g. add a label to a .resx file, this immediately updates the generated C# code, and now the label is immediately usable in my other C# code without having to build the whole application first)
- is not a hacky workaround

If the only solution to these requirements is the existing .resx workflow, then I would also accept an authoritative answer that draws from official documentation or a statement from a figure with authority inside Microsoft that explicitly mentions resource files with generated C# code as an acceptable, supported alternative to the  ILocalizer story."

"How to manipulate the ScrollController in Flutter's sliding up panel plugin?","<flutter><dart><plugins>","I need to get the Sliding up panel's Scrollcontroller to scroll the panel to the top on panel close.  So when I populate the panel with new data, and slide it up, it is displayed correctly.  The panel's scroll position basically needs to reset between uses.

This needs to be done without creating a different glitch. I've solved it by using a global ScrollController but that created a worse glitch where the panel behaved counter intuitively, the ScrollController scrolling content but also dragging the panel down."

You can assume that objects being put into the cache will have 'simple' constructors -- i.e., their args will be only strings, ints and floats, but can have any number of them (including 0). But they may be references (should probably be std::decay'd in order to store them in the map). Objects will be moveable but not copy-constructable. They will be immutable.

I'd prefer an unordered_map over a map for the cache (faster lookups), but either will do."

Isn't that annoying?

Hence, I would be extremely surprised if it is impossible to achieve in such a popular package. 

P.S. Note that always setting react-player to full-screen is not a solution, since there are people who prefer to see the course outline / notes / etc. at the time of watching the lesson."

"Linking Patreon API with a Flutter application","<flutter><dart><flutter-dependencies><patreon>","I know this is a very open/broad question, but I want it applicable any person starting a Flutter application. I'm really new to Flutter and I have little to no experience using an API, so I need someone very familiar with both (or smart enough to figure it out) to walk me through it. I think it would be good for anyone starting with Flutter and not wanting their app to be full of ads to have this as an alternative financial backing. 
So I'm adding a bounty onto the question hoping to get a detailed step by step guide with code examples and pictures OR it inspires someone to create a tutorial video on it. I'll be accepting the best anwser and if I get more reputation I'll certainly up the bounty before it expires. Thank you for your help!"

"No analytics cookies is set upon a consent was updated","<javascript><google-analytics><google-talk>","I am seeking for a solution to setup my website (both JS / HTML code and Google tag manager configuration) so it is GDPR compliant and cookies preferences are respected.

1) first visit - GTM is loaded with no consent given, GTM tags like Google Analytics are rendered but no cookies are set
2) user accepts the cookies - GTM consent is updated and GA cookies are set 
3) returning visit - once the Vue app fetches the configuration, GTM will allow the cookies

My understanding is that GTM must be one of the first scripts loaded so the analytics can really track each visit (even interrupted). There is a parameter wait_for_update which should configure a listening for the update message in the dataLayer with the fetched cookie preferences.

Well, take a look at https://beta.mezinamiridici.cz/ and you will see it yourself (GUI is in czech language, the cookie consent dialog is in the right bottom corner)."

Currently, Netezza does not accept the ""fuzzy join"" functions that I am using - this results in my code running ""offline"". I am looking for a way such that perhaps the ""fuzzy join"" functions can be converted into SQL (R based) such that Netezza will accept it.

Can someone please show me how to do this?

In recent years, a new ""Decision Tree"" style predictive model (e.g. supervised classification) has been developed such that the performance of this model in certain cases is theoretically guaranteed to perform stronger than classical Decision Trees such as CART. The name of this new Decision Tree algorithm is called ""CORLES"" (Certifiable Optimal Rules List). 

I am trying to implement this CORELS Decision Tree algorithm on the ""iris dataset"" in R (using this library https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corels/index.html) . However, I am running into problems when trying to implement it. 

Can someone please show me how to do this? 

Please let me know if you require any clarifications.

Thanks!

I am reading about a newer Decision Tree model called RLT (a predictive/statistical model for regression and classification). I was reading the paper in which this RLT model was proposed (please see the references) as well as the R documentation for this model: I am trying to figure out a way to ""extract the decision rules from this tree"" (e.g. if var_1 > a and var_2 <b then predict ""class 1""). 

I tried contacting the authors of this paper and searching the references for any possible solutions, but could not seem to find anything.

Can someone please show me how to extract the decision rules for the RLT Decision Tree model?

We have a good start of a solution, but :

1. the text crushes onto itself comparing to what a normal blockquote would display

2. the effect of a blockquote background color should be temporary: localized to the only part we are willing to apply it.  
The solution we currently have applies a background color definitively for the next blockquote and the ones following without being able to return to the ""_no background color_"" standard blockquote of markdown."

But since I use conda of OneAPI, it takes a time very long to launch and get the prompt (at least 10 seconds) : it is very annoying.

I tried to use a config file for setvars.sh sourcing :

source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh --config=""/opt/intel/oneapi/config_setvars.txt"" > /dev/null

with config_setvars.txt :

default=exclude
mkl=latest
idp=latest

But it takes still too much time (~ 8 seconds) to get the prompt of a launched terminal.

Is there a way to activate conda (and environment variables associated) with the file sourced setvars.sh ?"

I am using R - I figured out some initial steps in which I could generate all possible combinations of names and height combinations - now I am trying to figure out how to iterate between all these combinations according to the constraints provided. Can someone please show me how to do this using the R programming language? Thanks! Happy New Years! :)"

It's a shame that Microsoft either doesn't keep their template up to date, or provide documentation on what's going on.  Any solution that works and properly sets up the React Bootstrap libraries that are part of the template within VS 2019 will suffice, so long as it gets the collapse/nav collapse functionality properly working."
